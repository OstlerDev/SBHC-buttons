## About

The idea for the Emergency Response system was thought up as a way for cast members throughout the Haunted Circus to be able to report issues/incidents to security faster. The old way was slow, and caused for many issues to not be resolved in a timely manner. The idea is to have one of these emergency systems positioned in each location in the haunt. When actors have an issue, they can go and press the button that relates to the level of issue that they have.

## Setup

In order to setup the system, you first need to place the files on a webserver. These webserver files allow the buttons to store their state and information based on the current status. It also allows a hub for people to see the state of all trailers at once.

1) Add the files to the webserver
2) Fill in the database information
3) Profit
